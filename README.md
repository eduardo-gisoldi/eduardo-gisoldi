## Hi👋 My name is Luis Eduardo, but you can call me Edu, Lu or Luana!✨

I'm a Computer Science student at USCS (Universidade Municipal de São Caetano do Sul, from the state of São Paulo in Brasil) and have been in love with tech basically all my life! I love computers and computer progams, games, apps and much more related in the area. I am overcoming a slump period in my life and now at 24 years old am going after my passions in tech. I recently transferred from my old university where I had bad experiences and am looking forward to the next two years at USCS, the first months have been amazing and I feel so much progress in so little time.

- 🎓 I’m currently in my 3rd semester in the 8 semester progam of Comp. Sci. at my university.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects to develop my programming skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin, Java, C, Javascript, HTML&CSS, and more.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting started on the work dynamic in tech.
